# Electronics-Store-Application

I developed a robust online store application using Java and the Java Swing framework. This application offers a comprehensive shopping experience, allowing users to browse a wide range of products, add items to their cart, and securely complete their purchases.

The application features a user-friendly interface that displays products. Users can easily navigate through the product list. Once they find desired products, they can add them to their shopping cart and review their selections before proceeding to checkout.

To ensure a seamless shopping experience, the application incorporates a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices. This allows users to shop conveniently from their desktops, laptops, or mobile phones.

In addition to the core functionalities, the application also provides features for inventory management and sales analysis. This enables store owners to track product stock levels, monitor sales performance, and identify popular items.
